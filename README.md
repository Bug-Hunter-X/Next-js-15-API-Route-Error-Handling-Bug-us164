# Next.js 15 API Route Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with error handling in Next.js 15 API routes.  Errors thrown within `async` functions may not be consistently caught, leading to generic 500 errors without detailed information.

## Problem

The `pages/api/data.js` file contains an API route that simulates an asynchronous operation.  This operation might throw an error. In Next.js 15, this error might not be properly handled, leading to an unhelpful 500 server error.

## Solution

The `pages/api/dataSolution.js` file shows how to robustly handle these errors.  Always explicitly handle potential errors using `try...catch` blocks. Ensure informative error messages are returned to the client.  Consider more advanced error handling techniques for production environments.
